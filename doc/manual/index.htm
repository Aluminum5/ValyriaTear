                        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>The stamina bar:</b> When moving around, mainly in dangerous areas, you will most probably encounter enemies wandering around and chasing your character
                        if going close to them. When walking, you're moving slower than you're enemies, but when running, you will be able to escape them, at a cost:<br />
                        The more your character run, the more the stamina will deplete. Once empty, you won't be able to run anymore. Also, you'll have to stop pressing
                        the Running key (Default: 'D') for it to start filling again.<p />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; If an enemy catches you when the stamina bar is low, an agility malus will be applied on your party at the beginning of the fight.
                        The less full the bar is, the higher the malus will be.<p />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least, in friendly areas, where there are no enemies, the stamina bar will display an infinite symbol and disappear.
                        This means you can run as much as you want in the corresponding location.
