Valyria Tear is an attempt at creating a small J-RPG using an upgraded HoA engine (See http://www.allacrost.org/).

Development blog: http://valyriatear.blogspot.com

Linux compilation procedure:
Once you've unpacked the tarball or checked it out of Git, just run 'cmake . && make ' from the top-level directory at the prompt.

You'll then be able to play by typing: 'src/valyriatear'

Windows:
A Code::Blocks project file is also provided when compiling under Windows.
In that case, you might need the dependencies and headers files that can be downloaded at:
https://github.com/Bertram25/ValyriaTear/downloads
