/** ****************************************************************************
*** \brief Container class for representing the target of a battle action
***
*** Valid target types include attack points, actors, and parties. This class is
*** somewhat of a wrapper and allows a single instance of BattleTarget to represent
*** any of these types. It also contains a handful of methods useful in determining
*** the validity of a selected target and selecting another target of the same type.
***
*** Many of these functions are dependent on receiving a pointer to a BattleActor
*** object that is using or intends to use the BattleTarget object. This is necessary
*** because the different types of the GLOBAL_TARGET enum are relative and the class
*** selects different targets relative to the user. For example, selecting the next
*** actor when the target type is GLOBAL_TARGET_ALLY requires knowing whether the user
*** is a character or an enemy.
